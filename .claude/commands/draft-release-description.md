Can you help me draft a release description for my current changes.

1. Look at the previous release logs at https://github.com/DavidKoleczek/interop-router/releases your draft release MUST follow the same style and structure.
2. Look at my currently staged changes to identify what is changing.
3. Create a draft release description based on the recent code changes and place it in `ai_working/draft_release_{version}.md`
4. Make sure the pyproject.toml is updated with a new version number.
5. At the end be sure to include:
   1. **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/DavidKoleczek/interop-router/compare/vx1.y1.z1...vx2.y2.z2
   2.  Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/interop-router/x.y.z/).
